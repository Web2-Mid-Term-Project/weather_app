# Weather App

## JS

When you edit js files, you need to bundle the files to reflect changes.

To bundle them, run

```sh
npm run build
```

## SCSS

To compile scss to css, run

```sh
npm run sass
```

While editing scss files, you might want to run

```sh
npm run sass -- -w
```

This will compile css while editing scss files and reflect changes immediately.
